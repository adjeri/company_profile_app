# Flutter company profile

This is an app that shows a company profile. The emphasis here is to know more about Flutter animations. 
It displays an avatar, text, activities of the company in an horizontal ListView, and a button that opens a URL in the browser. 
Various animations (background picture blurred, listview scrolls from right to left,...) are displayed when widgets show up
